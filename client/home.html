    <h2>neuron-catalog</h2>

    <h4>A simple web database for keeping track of neurons</h4>

    neuron-catalog is a web-based database for small groups (e.g. a
    lab) collaborating on neuronal circuit mapping. It provides a
    simple platform to organize your notes about driver lines, neuron
    types, brain neurons and putative connectivity. Each group that
    wants to run the neuron-catalog can run their own server, as the
    software is free and open source (GNU Affero General Public
    License v3). Because it is run as an isolated, standalone
    database, the neuron-catalog can be used as a collaborative
    lab-notebook to record novel observations during the process of
    discovery. Thus, neuron-catalog complements large-scale efforts
    which require extensive curation by providing a collaboration
    platform before the data are ready for integration into a finished
    dataset.
