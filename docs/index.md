# neuron-catalog

A simple web database for keeping track of neurons

---

## Overview

neuron-catalog is a web-based database for small groups (e.g. a lab)
collaborating on neuronal circuit mapping. It provides a simple
platform to organize your notes about driver lines, neuron types,
brain neurons and putative connectivity. Each group that wants to run
the neuron-catalog can run their own server, as the software is free
and open source (GNU Affero General Public License v3). Because it is
run as an isolated, standalone database, the neuron-catalog can be
used as a collaborative lab-notebook to record novel observations
during the process of discovery. Thus, neuron-catalog complements
large-scale efforts which require extensive curation by providing a
collaboration platform before the data are ready for integration into
a finished dataset.
