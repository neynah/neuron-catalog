1. Build a docker container with:

    bin/build-docker.sh

2. Run the docker container initially with:

    bin/run.sh

3. Stop and restart the docker container with:

    docker stop fly-neuron-catalog
    docker start fly-neuron-catalog


# ---------------------

To update once edits are made, stop the container, rebuild and do an
initial run.sh. This will require re-naming the old container. FIXME:
how to do this non-destructively. That would seem to require a
solution to this: https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/3036
